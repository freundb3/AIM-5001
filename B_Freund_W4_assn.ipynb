To calculate the standard deviation, I used NumPy's \"std\" function, set the axis to 0 to refer to the columns, and used the index of 3 to retrieve the fourth column which contained the information requested. I then used the round function to round this number to two decimal places. Thus, I calculated the standard deviation of the fourth column, and I got 31.52 gallons per person per day. I then printed both the mean and the standard deviation in sentence form.\n",

To do this, I used NumPy's \"diff\" function, set the axis to 0 to refer to the columns, and used the index [:,1] to refer to the appropriate column. I stored this in an array called pop_diff_floating. However, pop_diff_floating stores everything as floating points and not integers. Therefore, I changed the type of pop_diff_floating to an integer and stored it in a new array called pop_diff.
